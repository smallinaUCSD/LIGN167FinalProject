Hi everybody, and welcome to the very last video of the quarter here for Linguistics 101.
So, today's plan is pretty straightforward.
We'll talk about your linguistic future, we'll talk about Dostoevsky, case and translation theory,
and we'll talk about what a life in language might look like.
So, your linguistic future.
It's time to admit it.
We've been kind of dancing around this all quarter, but it's time to admit it.
You secretly want, or maybe overtly want, to major or minor in linguistics.
Maybe a little tiny bit, maybe that little bit of your heart is crying out,
maybe you're not ready to listen yet, maybe you still, you know, but that's okay.
If you ever decide that, you know what, it's time, I need to go deeper,
then this is the address you need to go to.
Meet with our advisor, we'll help you out.
Because we really do want to help you out.
Join us and we will complete your training.
The saddest part of Ling 101 is that it is, at least it's sad for me,
maybe not for you, I don't know, but is that it's so short.
There are so many amazing things in language that we've had to leave behind, right?
And so the joy of the major is getting to interact in more depth with each one of these subfields.
To go into the awesomeness of phonology that maybe never was covered in this,
well, it certainly never was covered in this class.
Or that you wouldn't have had time to cover in any intro class anywhere, right?
This class could be three quarters long and it would still just scrape the surface of all of this.
And because this is important, because I think many of you are already linguists and you don't know it yet.
The reason I say that is because you don't generally just happen into a linguistics class, right?
Usually there's some little bit of you in the back of your mind.
Or maybe you're a person with some affinity already.
I mean, you people are out there, right?
Like serial language learners.
If you have Duolingo installed and that owl is yelling at you in four different languages,
you might actually be a linguist. You might not know that yet.
If you are a person who has taken a bunch of languages and wants to take even more,
yeah, you might be a linguist.
Language analyzers, even people who aren't interested as much in foreign languages,
but love picking apart sentences.
Somebody will say something and you're like, oh wow, that's really weird.
Why did they say it that way?
Yeah, you might be a linguist.
Maybe you're easily distracted by odd language use.
If somebody uses a brand new word, you're not just like, oh, that was weird.
You're like, wait, where did you learn that? What does that come from?
Oh my God, I've never heard that before. Tell me, tell me more.
Maybe you're fascinated just by differences and similarities among languages.
This is often the case for bilingual folks.
You grow up and you're aware of like, wow, I have these entirely two different worlds inside of my mind,
but they're similar in these ways, but they're different in these.
This can be very easy, or even among dialects.
Maybe you're a person who just loves, you know, I think I can guess where you're from.
You're probably a linguist.
Look, if any of these things sound like you, you might be a linguist in denial.
Or of course, this is probably the very, very best evidence.
Yeah, that's me.
You know who else didn't know he was a linguist at one point in time?
This guy. Yeah.
Yeah.
This was me, actually, just starting my sophomore year of college.
And at that time, I didn't think I was a linguist yet.
And so I want to tell you actually a little bit about my linguistic journey,
because it'll highlight some really amazing parts of language,
and because it'll give you a sense of, well, how you might end up here.
Whether that's a cautionary tale or something you'd like to emulate, I'll leave that up to you.
But let's talk a little bit about how I ended up here, because I think that's useful.
I started college as a Russian major.
I was going to be a translator.
At that moment, I thought to myself, wow, language is kind of cool.
There's hint number one.
I should be a translator.
I should go out.
I should work for the UN or something like that.
That was my idea.
That was my goal.
But then linguistics kind of hunted me down, right?
And the way that it did so was with case.
I've talked about case now a couple of times in this class,
because when we talked about grammatical relations,
we've talked about different ways that languages can show us how a language marks who did what to whom, right?
And English uses word order to mark grammatical relations.
We've talked about this already, but it's not the only way.
In case-marking systems, you use inflectional morphology to mark grammatical relations.
You use these inflectional morphemes, and you stick them onto the end of a word to say,
this is the role that this thing has in the sentence.
This is the role that this thing has in the sentence.
And as a result, you end up with a lot of good clarity, very often at least,
in terms of who did what to whom.
And so Russian.
Remember, I started as a Russian major.
I was going to be a translator.
And Russian, oh, Russian has case.
And every case marker corresponds to a grammatical role.
Ignore that 245.
I don't know why it's in there, but hey, PowerPoint.
Well, not actually PowerPoint, but still.
The nominative case in Russian handles what is generally considered the subject,
that is, the subject of an intransitive sentence,
as well as the subject of a transitive sentence.
So like in I eat, I'm in nominative case.
Or if I threw the ball, I'm still nominative, right?
Accusative case handles the object.
The thing, if I threw the ball, the ball is the thing that's in accusative, right?
Or if I see the cat, the cat is in accusative.
It's the object of the sentence.
So in Russian, we talked about this, I think, already.
I might have given you this exact example, right?
The dog sees or saw the ball.
So, or I'm sorry, the dog saw the cat.
Later on.
So the dog we would have here in the sentence is the dog saw the cat.
We would have dog in nominative case.
It's the seer.
And the cat is in accusative case.
And it's a feminine ending because cat is a feminine word in Russian.
We didn't even get into grammatical gender.
We didn't get into grammatical gender.
Anyways, I digress.
So the dog is nominative.
The cat is accusative because it's being seen.
But if we swap those endings around, if suddenly we get кошка instead of кошку,
and if we suddenly get собаку rather than собака,
wow, my Russian is bad today.
If we swap the nominative and the accusative, then suddenly the cat saw the dog.
All you need to do is switch those morphemes around,
and suddenly the meaning of the sentence changes, right?
And so similarly, you have pronouns with different case markings.
So я тебя вижу means I, you, see.
And I is nominative.
You are accusative.
I see you.
But if it's you see me, you could say ты меня видишь.
So you goes into nominative.
I go into accusative.
And see.
And the word order changed here, but that's mostly just for pragmatics,
for information marking.
So I see you and you see me.
The pronouns are in different cases.
In both cases, the agent or the person doing the thing, the subject,
is in nominative, and the person being seen is in accusative case.
And so you change the pronouns around.
Я becomes меня, and ты becomes тебя.
Awesome, right?
So, thinking about it this way.
If the nominative case is for the subject,
and the accusative case is for the object,
if I have the sentence, Nilu hugged the turtle,
and I were to put it into Russian,
the proper cases, the proper case that you would choose would be
A, Nilu's nominative, turtle's accusative.
B, Nilu accusative, turtle's nominative.
C, Nilu's nominative, turtle's nominative.
And D, both are accusative.
So, think about it for a second.
So if Nilu hugged the turtle, Nilu is the agent,
it's the subject of this sentence here.
And so she would go into the nominative case,
and the turtle is being hugged,
therefore the turtle would go into accusative.
So the correct answer here is A.
So, in Russian, this actually frees some things up, right?
You can use word order for pragmatics.
I can say,
and I can say,
I can say,
Note that the morphemes haven't changed.
I've just changed the word order.
And as a result, this means the cat saw the dog.
I can say,
the cat saw the dog.
All of these things,
even though the word order is different one to one,
all of these mean the same thing.
But informationally, they're a little bit different.
This here is emphasizing the cat.
This is emphasizing the seeing.
This is emphasizing the dog.
All three of those things mean the same thing,
but I can say,
No, the cat saw the dog.
Whereas in English, we have to use prosody to do that,
and Russian word order can be used for this.
This is just awesome as sort of an aside.
And this is why Russian is considered often a non-configurational language.
It just doesn't, syntax doesn't do the same things in Russian
as it does in some other languages.
Although syntax still plays a role.
And you'll probably,
I don't know if you'll get into that in 121,
but hopefully you will.
It's awesome.
Ask your syntactician about that.
So yeah, that's fun.
And by the way, English has case two, right?
I see him.
I is nominative.
Him is accusative, right?
Him is the accusative form of he.
Similarly, he sees me.
He is nominative, and me is accusative.
So you wouldn't say me see him, right?
That doesn't work.
Or him see me, or him see I,
none of those would work.
You need to use the nominative accusative program.
English used to have a full case system,
but it's kind of fallen off.
What else has case actually is a little strange,
and that's geonosian.
So I think it's time that I confess to you all
that I'm kind of a nerd, right?
And one of the domains of my nerddom is Star Wars.
I encourage you not to get me started on the last three here recently,
but at the very least,
and I'm not, the prequels too,
but in the second movie,
we're going to put aside my feelings here
because they are strong and they are many.
We had a book series.
Anyways, you were the chosen one.
The geonosians in episode two,
the second of the prequel movies,
there was this species of animals
called the geonosians or aliens,
or I don't know whether they're animals or not.
That's the semantics.
We'll see.
But they looked like this, and they flew,
and they spoke a language that was very, very clicky, right?
They had a lot of clicks and a lot of sounds
that weren't actually possible with human tongues.
But in this language,
I happened to notice that they had case marking
because in one scene, they were talking about,
because every time they talked,
they would speak in geonosian,
and then it would be subtitled.
And I noticed that in one sentence,
they said, count Dooku.
So Dooku is a word,
and they had Dooku in an agent position
or a nominative position,
and it was Dooku.
And then in another position,
they had Dooku, or another sentence, that is,
they had Dooku as an object,
and it was Dookoa.
That's case.
That's case marking.
So geonosian,
we don't know anything really about this language.
I don't know how fully it was designed.
I don't know who came up with it,
but I'm pretty damn sure it has case marking.
If you go back and look at it,
you'll probably see that as well.
By the way,
I still didn't think I was a linguist at this point.
I was just a Russian major.
I just happened to see geonosian, right?
But Russian, coming back to Russian again,
which was, in a lot of ways,
maybe not my first love.
Maybe Spanish was there,
but still,
it was definitely one of my more passionate affairs.
My wife, of course.
Yeah, winning, but still.
The Russian case system is really complex.
We've talked about nominative and accusative,
where nominative marks the subject,
and the accusative marks the direct object,
the thing that's being thrown,
the thing that's being seen.
There's also the dative case,
which marks a recipient.
Something like,
I gave Lisa flowers,
Lisa would be the recipient of the flowers, right?
Genitive case,
the possessor.
So the thing that possesses something goes in genitive.
The locative case shows the location of an event.
Instrumental case shows a tool
or an instrument being used to accomplish something.
And it formerly actually had a vocative case,
where you call out somebody's name,
you'd put that in vocative.
So the genitive case marks possession,
generally speaking.
It allows you,
well, genitively speaking, I suppose.
The genitive case allows you to put
who owns something
or who has something in their possession.
So if I have a sentence like,
I see the dog's ball.
I see the dog's ball.
In that case, I go into nominative case
because, well,
nominative case is,
I'm the subject, right?
The ball is accusative.
That's the thing that I'm seeing.
And then the dog owns the ball.
So the dog is put into genitive case.
Similarly, if I see John's book,
John goes into the genitive case
because John is the owner of the book.
In some ways, the English z,
like putting the apostrophe s,
is genitive-y,
although it's not obviously quite the same thing.
So that's genitive case in action.
Locative case marks the location of events,
where something took place.
It's also called prepositional case
sometimes in Russian.
But the locative case
would be something like this.
I live in California.
Я живу в Калифорнии.
In this case,
я живу is I live,
past tense,
or I'm sorry,
present tense, that is,
nominative case for me,
locative case for California
because California
is the location of that living.
Instrumental case
marks an object being used
to accomplish a task
and sometimes something
that you accomplish something with.
So Andres пишет карандашом.
So Andres writes with a pencil.
Andres goes nominative,
write third-person singular,
he writes,
with a pencil.
Pencil goes into instrumental case.
We don't need any prepositions.
It's just карандашом.
And because of that case ending,
we know that that's what he wrote with.
Similarly,
I eat borscht with sour cream.
Я ем борщт со сметаной.
We put sour cream
in the instrumental case.
Even though it's not technically
like you're eating the borscht
using sour cream,
it can still have that meaning
of I ate it with that
as an accessory.
So instrumental case does that.
And then finally,
maybe finally,
dative case.
It marks the indirect object
or the recipient of an item.
So something like
Кевин дает святи Лисе.
Kevin gave Lisa flowers.
Kevin, nominative.
Flowers, accusative
because they're the thing being given.
And then Lisa is the recipient.
Lisa is the beneficiary
of the flowers.
Анчелади не дала Нилу.
So in this case,
анчелада is an accusative case.
They're what are being given.
I am in the dative
because I'm receiving the anchiladas.
And then past feminine
and then Нилу
is in the nominative case
because she is the giver
of the anchiladas.
So in this case,
we would have мене,
the мене,
that is the dative form
for first person singular.
You can also use dative
for goals and beneficiaries.
Like я помогаю Кевину.
I helped Kevin.
Or I'm sorry,
I'm helping Kevin.
That would be
I am in the first person singular
nominative form.
So I am me
and I'm doing the action.
And then Kevin is the recipient
of the help.
Kevin goes into dative.
Similarly, Барак Обама,
мне звонил Барак Обама,
Барак Обама called me.
I go into the dative case
because I am receiving
the phone call.
I am the beneficiary
of the call.
And Барак is, of course,
the nominative case.
And no, he didn't.
So if we put the sentence
Joanie gave Dieter some pellets
into Russian,
what would the proper cases be?
A. Joanie would be accusative.
B. Or I'm sorry,
Joanie accusative,
Dieter dative,
pellets nominative.
B. Joanie nominative,
Dieter dative,
pellets accusative.
C. Joanie nominative,
Dieter accusative,
pellets dative.
Or D. Joanie dative,
Dieter accusative,
pellets nominative.
Deserve some tea.
So do you.
Assuming you like tea.
So if we do this correctly,
Joanie is the giver, right?
Joanie is the agent.
So the Joanie should be
in nominative case, right?
So that narrows it down
to B and C, right?
Dieter is the recipient
of the pellets.
So Dieter needs to be
in the dative case.
And then that leaves us with B.
And pellets are the thing
that are being given.
So therefore,
we know the correct answer
is B.
The giver,
the recipient,
and the things being given.
So that's the Russian case system.
Nominative,
accusative,
dative,
genitive,
locative.
And then instrumental as well,
which is awesome.
I had to add that in there
because my prosody was wrong.
I dropped on locative
when I should have dropped
on instrumental.
See, prosody is magic.
But it's actually
much more complicated than this.
The Russian case system
is just amazingly complex.
But I want to tell you about it
because it has a major role
in some of these things.
And by the way,
all this looks like argument roles
we were talking about earlier.
Wow, amazing.
Now you know the Russian system.
You're probably wondering
why do you care?
Even though you now know it
just in case.
Case.
Okay.
English is very capable
of handling nominative
and accusative, right?
We have it.
We have I and me.
We have he and him, right?
We can swap those things around.
So English is okay with nominative.
It's okay with accusative.
Those things work out.
Dative case doesn't work.
We just can't even do dative case.
We have trouble with this.
And this in turn
causes massive troubles
for translation.
This is the first time
we've really talked about translation
in this class,
but translation is a really,
really difficult thing
because all of these
different facets of grammar
that we've talked about
so far this quarter
make languages differ
from one another
in a bunch of different ways.
And they're awesome ways, right?
The different elements of grammar
make languages divergent.
It makes them tricky sometimes.
And individual unique properties
of languages
can make what they're expressing
very interesting,
very different,
and very hard to express
in another language.
And this is fundamentally
the problem that translators face, right?
So imagine that you've got
a crazy person,
in this case, Fyodor Dostoevsky.
And I say that with all the love.
He's an amazing author.
And you've written a book
called Crime and Punishment.
Here's my copy, actually,
from college.
Hey!
But Crime and Punishment
is just,
it's an absolutely amazing book.
It's absolutely nuts.
It feels like a fever dream,
basically,
is the best way
I can describe this book.
But I was taking a class
in Dostoevsky in college,
because, remember,
a Russian major.
And I happened,
I was reading this book,
and then I happened upon a quote.
And that quote
sort of turned me into a linguist.
This is the quote here.
In Russian,
Упокой, господь, мёртвых,
оживим и сожит.
This sentence
turns out to be
super-duper,
duper hard to translate.
What would,
what does this mean in practice?
One translation,
and sort of
one of the more authoritative
translations,
has this as
God give peace to the dead,
the living have still to live.
That's a weird sentence, right?
Another translation has
May the Lord grant rest
to the souls of the dead,
and let life be the realm
of the living.
That is one Russian sentence
up there.
These two are
very, very different
translations, right?
This has entirely
different words in it
that weren't present.
Another translation,
this one actually,
which is, by the way,
the one I generally
recommend to people,
English, well,
to English speakers, yes.
You would read it in English
if you're an English speaker.
But Pivir and Volkonsky
do a great work.
They have
May the Lord grant rest
to the dead,
but the living have still
got to live.
This is, again,
a third translation,
very, very different.
A little bit more similar
to the Garnet translation,
but still.
And then, of course,
everybody's favorite translator,
Google Translate,
God rest the dead,
but still live alive.
Yeah.
So, why does this one sentence
have such a diversity
of translations?
This one Russian sentence,
how does it create
all of this difference?
Why is this so hard
to translate?
So, let's look at it.
У покой господь мертвый.
First chunk of this.
If we were to break this apart
into Russian morphemes,
we have out.
So that у at the front of it
means like out or away.
У покой means like
уходи is like go away,
get away from me.
So that у generally means
out or away.
Rest is, well,
to rest, right?
And then this is imperative.
This is a command,
у покой,
like rest,
like rest somebody.
And then God is the agent here.
God is nominative case.
And then the dead are accusative.
So what you are saying is,
hey God,
make the dead rest,
like rest the dead.
This is not something
that English can do, right?
We can't use rest transitively.
I can't, for instance,
well, actually,
I guess you can.
You can rest a field
or something like that,
or you can rest a piece of equipment.
I'm going to rest that tractor
for a week to see if the oil,
I don't know.
But by and large,
we don't do that in English.
So having God as the nominative case,
dead as the accusative,
and then an imperative here,
that's tough enough, right?
And so this is a command.
And they're not receiving the rest,
by the way.
The dead are not receiving rest.
It's not like God give the dead rest.
It's just like rest them.
Put them down there and rest them, right?
So this is tricky in and of itself,
and it gives rise to different things.
God give peace to the dead.
So this makes some sense, right?
Because you can give somebody peace,
but you can't really rest somebody.
So I can see why Constance Garnett
might have gone this route.
May the Lord grant rest.
So okay, grant rest to the souls of the dead.
Feels a little more dative,
feels a little more recipient-y.
And by the way, souls is nowhere in here.
Russian has a word for soul,
and it's not in that quote.
But still, may the Lord grant rest
to the souls of the dead.
Kind of gives that feeling of like
you're giving the rest to them, I guess.
May Lord grant rest to the dead.
So again, this is like giving the rest
rather than rest them.
And again, this is to the dead,
so it's less like for beneficiary stuff.
And then Google God rest the dead.
That's actually kind of okay, right?
Упокой, rest, and then God is there,
and then the dead is just there.
So they didn't bother with any of the flowery stuff,
just like God rest the dead.
Actually, at some level,
Google Translate's got a point here.
Оживим еще жить, the other half.
But the living, dative case, still to live.
That's all.
But, а, еще, still, жить,
is like the verb to live.
But then there's this живим, living, dative.
The act of living is what's continuing,
the still living.
So still living is that chunk there.
But the living are not doing the living.
The living are receiving their living.
For the living, the living are the beneficiaries
of that still living, right?
They are receiving it.
So how do you handle this in translation?
English does not have a dative case.
We are not able to cope with this.
The living have still got to live.
So what this is saying is like,
almost as a feeling of obligation, right?
The living have still got to live.
That's very different.
That's very, that's crazy.
So this is very, very different
than the original meaning.
Like, this is an obligation for them.
It is still ahead of them,
when in reality, it's a gift,
according to this dative, right?
Let life be the realm of the living.
Okay, David McNuff.
But the living have still got to live.
This is interesting.
Have still got.
Like they've still received.
But even still, this feels a little bit off.
There's no real good way in English
to handle that dative stuff.
But still live alive.
Yeah, no.
Je vime.
Yeah, that's, that's, yeah,
those are the alive people, right?
And I mean, they got all the words, but no.
This is, none of these are really,
strictly speaking, faithful
to what's actually going on here.
None of them really capture the dativeness.
The fact that the living
are the recipients of this.
And all of this, by the way,
ignores conversational context.
All of this, the context, of course,
being they just found out
about somebody's death,
and somebody was trying
to kind of manically move them,
because manic, Dostoevsky,
manically move the conversation along.
Well, okay, God grant rest of the dead,
but the living, we've still got to live.
Yeah.
But it ignores all kinds
of connotational information
and things like that,
and that's yet another thing
that you have to worry about
in translation.
But you end up with all kinds
of different translations.
The translation I'm giving this,
based on, you know,
linguistic discussion,
based on serious linguistic business,
is this.
God, take the dead and rest them.
But those living
are still given a life to live.
Now, this is awful, right?
I hope that given everything
we've talked about,
you understand that
that's pretty accurate.
We've got God.
You're giving God a command.
You're telling him
to rest the dead directly.
But those living, the jivim,
still are given a life.
They still have that life
given to them, dative, to live.
This is pretty accurate,
but it's awful.
It's a terrible English sentence.
And think about it.
Look at all these translations.
Given what you've said,
or given what we've said here,
which one of these feels best?
Which do you find
is most pleasing to read?
And if you choose
the Google Translate one,
I'm going to be a little sad.
For most people, in practice,
the one that they like most
is probably B.
B is the Peaver and Volkonsky
translation.
This is a very English-forward one.
They've done a pretty good job
of balancing the needs
of the Russian and the English,
but it's still a thing.
And this is always a tension.
As you are doing translation,
you have to decide
whether you want to favor L1,
the original language,
or L2, the language
that you're moving into.
And as you're doing this,
you have these competing constraints.
On one hand,
you want to make it accurate.
You want your translation
to be, well, accurate.
You want it to sound right.
But you also want it to flow well.
You want it to be literature.
You want it to be readable.
If I were to go through
and translate this book
in the same way
that I translated that sentence,
it would be a cursed object.
Like, I could hold this up
at Muggers and they would run away.
Like, that's the level of bad
my translations would be there
because I'm not a translator
and I'm completely
over-favoring accuracy.
So my sentence,
God take the dead and rest them,
but the living are still
given a life to live,
is a horrible English sentence.
And the Garnet translation,
give peace to the dead,
the living have still to live,
that's not a terrible sentence.
I'm sorry.
But nonetheless,
you will always have
this kind of translation,
this tension.
Garnet is a little bit
more faithful to the Russian
than Pivir and Volkonsky.
Garnet is also a good deal older.
Garnet was a contemporary
of Tolstoy.
So this is an old translation.
This is the one you find
for free on Project Gutenberg
and such.
But still,
at least I think that's on there.
Yeah, it is.
And Brothers Karmasov too.
Anyways, this is a little bit
less faithful than mine,
but it's a little bit less flowy
than the Pivir and Volkonsky
translation.
And then there's Google Translate,
which is its own little bit of joy.
But this brought me
to a conclusion.
As I was doing this essay,
and this turned into
an entire final paper,
and God bless the instructor
of that class,
Vicky Hendrickson,
absolutely amazing instructor
at CU Boulder.
I dropped this proposal
on the table,
like I would like to do
my entire final project
on how to translate
this one sentence.
And she kind of looked at me
like, okay,
I don't understand you,
but I'm in.
Yeah, sure.
Let's do it.
And so I did it.
And the end result of this
was like, oh God,
this isn't a science.
Translation is art.
Translation is really difficult.
You cannot capture
Russian nuance in English
and vice versa.
And all of the translations
are going to either favor
the original language
or favor the new language,
favor the L1 or the L2.
And so you need to learn,
by the way,
as a consumer of translated goods,
which you prefer.
Some people prefer
reading books
that are very faithful
to the original.
Some people prefer
reading very flowy books.
I think a lot of people
will prefer
the very flowy versions.
But you learn
which you prefer
and then you use it.
And translation theory
is yet another branch
of linguistics
that struggles
with exactly these issues.
But it led me to the feeling,
and this is a well-known quote,
that all translations
are well-meaning lies.
And it's true.
It really is.
There is not accurate translation.
There can be.
I mean, in some cases,
saying yes and saying yes
like, see, yes, hey, accurate.
But by and large,
any translation worth a damn
is not going to capture
exactly what was said.
This is part of the reason
that I have so much respect
for translators,
for interpreters,
for people who are able to sit,
for instance,
at the front of a classroom
and in real time
interpret one language, English,
into another language,
for instance, ASL,
and to do it with any degree
of accuracy,
with any degree of flow
and faithfulness.
This is an amazing...
I have so much respect
for translators.
But it's important to remember
that at the end of the day,
it's not perfect, right?
This is an art,
not a science.
And the people doing it
are amazing artists.
But it is not exactly faithful,
right?
Every translation that you read
is not the same thing
as the source text.
And in fact,
this has been shown
over and over again.
Different cultures around the world
have different views
on translation.
For instance,
I believe it is the case
that in Islam,
the Qur'an is not...
You haven't read the Qur'an
if you've read a translation of it.
You need to read the Qur'an
in its original Arabic
in order for you
to sort of be seen
as actually studying it.
So this is...
That's a very strong take.
Like there is not...
Like translation
is not good enough for this.
And so thinking about translation
as well-meaning lies
is helpful.
But this broke me.
This broke me 100%,
because at the moment
I was doing this,
I was thinking,
Oh God,
I want to be a translator.
And yet,
I don't know
that I can do this.
How is anybody supposed
to translate anything?
How...
Is accurate translation
even a thing?
Is inaccurate translation
even a thing?
I was scared.
I was genuinely like...
And look,
as far as,
you know,
crises of identity go,
this one wasn't so bad.
But still,
oh my God,
I needed help.
I was completely lost.
So I took Ling 101.
I thought,
Okay,
you know what?
Let me see
what the linguists
have to say about this.
What do they do anyway?
They just speak a bunch
of languages.
What do they know?
And so I walk in,
Ling 101.
Hey,
how many languages do you speak?
No,
I don't think I...
I might have done that.
Let's be real here.
So I took Ling 101.
I took it with this guy,
Zygmunt Freisinger.
CU Boulder.
Absolutely amazing linguist.
He's a field linguist
specializing in languages
of Africa,
actually Hausa,
as well as related languages
a great teacher for 101.
And I took the class.
It was like,
oh my God,
this is awesome.
They're engaging
with all the stuff
that people don't talk about
in these language textbooks.
They're talking about the sounds,
not the writing system.
They're talking about
these weird changes
that keep happening
at the end of these words
in Russian
that no one really talks about.
Like,
oh my God,
we're engaging with it.
It's right there.
People talk about
this stuff directly
rather than beating around
the bush in textbooks
and making you
memorize dialogues.
I'm not memorizing dialogues.
I'm memorizing grammar.
And so I took Ling 101
and I declared
a linguistics major
like halfway through the class
because I was hooked.
I wanted more.
And then I took phonetics
the next quarter.
And then I took
morphosyntax.
They were combined
at that school.
And then I took phonology.
Then I took the equivalent
for Ling 8,
language in U.S. society.
Then I took semantics.
I took pragmatics.
Then I did some
independent studies
on translation theory.
And then,
by the way,
you should do this.
If you have anything
that you're really
passionate about,
start talking to faculty
in your department
and see if anybody
would be willing
to supervise
an independent study.
It's a great experience
for everybody involved.
But then,
at that point,
after I took
all these classes
as an undergrad,
I realized,
oh my God,
I'm this.
This is me.
I like this stuff.
I want to keep doing this.
And I couldn't picture
doing anything else
with my life
but to keep going.
And so that's why
you start looking
at grad schools.
And I'm going to be real
with you here for a second.
Grad school,
particularly in linguistics,
is the easiest thing
you can imagine
doing with your life.
If you're thinking,
well,
I could go to grad school
with linguistics
or I could be perfectly
happy doing X,
chances are the easier path
is going to be doing
something else
in your life.
Right?
Just,
it's not a straightforward path.
So I started looking
at grad schools though
because for me,
it was just like,
I can't not think
about vowels.
I can't,
I'm going to do this anyways.
I might as well
maybe get paid
for it someday.
Right?
So I looked at grad schools.
I'll put a link about that.
But it was for me
and I got into
one of my grad schools.
One out of the four
I applied to.
I got into one.
One!
But that's okay.
That's all I needed.
Right?
It was sad
and my application
was hot garbage.
I'm going to be real
with you here.
In retrospect,
ooh,
I'm glad I got into one.
And I stayed at
CU Boulder actually.
They accepted me
into their program there
and I got my,
I started grad school there.
And so if you want
to go into linguistics
grad school,
it's going to look
a little bit different
than every program,
but chances are
you're going to take phonetics,
you're going to take phonology,
and morphology, syntax,
semantics, pragmatics.
Weird.
That looks a lot like
the structure of Ling 101.
Amazing.
It's almost like
patterns repeat.
Whoa!
Nesting?
In my linguistics?
It's more likely
than you think.
So I went to
linguistics grad school
and I started taking
these classes.
But I also took classes
like field methods.
Field methods
is an amazing class
and if you have a chance
to take it,
once you've got some more
But the idea with field methods
is they sit a small
number of people
down in a room
with a speaker of a language
and no one speaks.
They say,
okay, go, figure it out.
Boom.
That's it.
And you're there
with a faculty member
and they're willing,
they're able to kind of
guide you through
the process of going,
okay,
uh,
huh,
how do you say fish?
Let's start there.
And then you move on
and move on and move on
and move on.
But field methods covers
how you actually do
field linguistics.
An amazing class.
Then I took more courses
in computational linguistics.
Oh my God,
that's amazing too.
Language acquisition,
phonetic theory,
because at that point
I knew I was a Ph. linguist.
Right?
There's this common distinction
that we discuss
in the linguistics community
between Ph. linguists,
phonetics, phonologies,
or P-side linguists.
Phonetics, phonology,
sometimes morphology
falls there,
and S-linguists,
syntax, semantics,
and often pragmatics
falls there too.
I knew I was a P-side person.
That was just how
my brain worked.
And so I went deeper
in phonetics
and phonology and such.
I took diachronic linguistics,
looking at language reconstruction,
that kind of thing.
Took statistics,
because that's going to be
increasingly useful
as we go through the world.
Right?
And then I did the
LSA Summer Institute.
This is an awesome experience.
You can do this as a grad student
or as an undergrad actually.
It's every two years,
and in 2021
it's at UMass Amherst,
I hope.
But that's a link
to check it out there.
And then there you go,
basically you pick a school
and then they just send
all of the linguists there.
You get professors
from all around the country.
This is the
Linguistic Society of America.
So professors from
all around the country
apply to teach classes there
and they choose the classes
they like most.
And then they all go there
for about a month
and then a bunch of students
come there for about a month
and you all stay there
and it's just this gigantic
linguistic-y nerd fest.
And it's absolutely amazing.
You'll also be put to work,
whether as a TA
or a graduate instructor
in grad school.
Right?
Many of your,
well all of your graduate TAs
are doing exactly that
right now.
You are in a classroom.
You're working with students
or maybe you can be
a researcher too.
Pardon me.
For some of my time
in graduate school
I was on research projects
rather than teaching.
Well I love teaching
so I'm very happy to be here.
But anyways,
working on and managing
research projects
is another possibility.
You'll also write large papers
both for publication
in journals
and also for the department itself
alongside your coursework.
So there will be
two or three major papers
that you'll write.
Dissertation proposals,
experiments,
things like that.
And then after all that
you write a dissertation.
And a dissertation
in a doctoral program
is a very large research project
where you just advance
the knowledge of the field
just a little.
Like if this is how much
we know as a field,
your dissertation does that.
Just a little tiny bit
more knowledge
sticking up past there.
You're advancing
the knowledge of the field
just a little tiny bit.
Mine was on the acoustical
and perceptual features
of vowel nasality.
Basically if I say E, E,
how can you hear
the difference there?
Really little tiny subject
but still 160 pages?
A lot.
It was a lot of work.
And then I got a PhD.
Here's me in a nerdy hat.
And here's my dissertation advisor.
This is Dr. Rebecca Scarborough
at CU Boulder.
An absolutely wonderful linguist.
Then I went on
and I got a postdoc.
So very often
after you get your PhD
you go in the job market.
And maybe in a perfect world
you go immediately
into a faculty position.
Some people pull it off.
It's absolutely amazing.
I ended up going
into a postdoc
which is a postdoctoral
research fellowship.
In this case
the University of Michigan
and specifically
a couple of folks
in their phonetics department
needed somebody
who worked on vowel nasality.
It was like,
that's like me
and ten other people.
Oh my God, yes.
I am there.
And so I was in Michigan
for a few years.
And while I was there
I was doing my own work.
As a postdoc
I was working
on some of my own stuff.
I published my own papers.
I was helping other folks
work on their research.
I was running a lab for them.
I advised grad students
and undergrads.
Grad students would come in
and go,
Will, I've got problems.
And I said,
Here, have a seat.
We can work.
And advising undergrads as well.
Guiding research projects.
Sometimes you teach
courses in postdocs.
I didn't.
That made me a little sad
but that's okay.
That wasn't the nature
of my postdoc.
But it's a time
to grow as a scholar.
It's a time
to get publications.
In my case it was huge.
I got so much out
of doing that
because it was
a different department.
It was a different
set of problems.
And I was forced
to try things
that I hadn't really
tried before.
So linguists actually
have a number
of jobs available.
Both in the academic world
as well as outside it.
So we should talk about
a couple of those things
out there.
One thing that's actually
a lot of folks
don't quite realize
is that linguists
make great data scientists.
Because at some level
we're great at patterns.
That's what we do.
Chances are if you're
in this class
and you're loving it,
you're loving finding patterns.
In data sets.
In language generally.
In sentences.
We're good at chasing down
and finding little
fiddly patterns
and making rules
and things like that.
So for data science
that's a really good skill.
The other thing is that
linguists usually have
experience working
with language data.
And so often now
data is not just
in numbers,
it's in words.
It's in sentences.
People are collecting
even in marketing forms
like how do you feel
about this product?
And that's really hard
to deal with
if you're only able
to deal with
one through five.
So linguists are very,
very commonly
pulled into data science
these days.
And a lot of people
who've decided
not to go the academic route
have decided that
data science is a great
place to end up.
Industry also loves
computational folks.
So if you have any
computational background
you should be able
to find something.
For instance,
text-to-speech,
which is how Siri
knows how to talk to us.
And automatic
speech recognition,
which is why Siri
has trouble listening
to us, right?
All of those things
are definitely
computational linguistics
worlds.
If you're curious
at all about this,
take Ling 6.
It's a really good
intro to this.
It's at a very
accessible level.
And you'll be prepared
for it because
you've taken 101s.
You know some of the
other, you know some
of the basic concepts
we're discussing,
but there we'll be
applying them
directly to computers.
So places like Google,
Facebook, and Apple
are absolutely hiring.
And they want linguists
desperately to be able
to analyze these things.
The Department of Defense,
at least here in the U.S.,
loves linguists.
Like the NSA, CIA, FBI,
all want linguists
for analysis.
Because not only
are they interested
in doing things like
computational linguistics
and all the kinds
of tasks generally,
but also things like
regional linguistics.
Okay, for instance,
if there's a conflict
in an area of the world,
they might want
somebody to go there
and figure out,
okay, what are
the different dialects?
That way, if they get
a phone call,
they can figure out
who's talking, right?
These are the kinds
of things that linguists
do and many, many more.
I can't give you
concrete examples
because it's classified.
But if that's something
you'd be comfortable doing,
this is a really
good place to go.
There's also translation
opportunities like crazy.
Linguists definitely
can make great translators.
There's also language
teaching, like at the
Defense Language Institute
in Boston.
So there's that.
The Department of Defense
definitely has jobs
for linguists.
You can teach English
as a second language.
It seems these days
like everybody wants
people to teach English
as a second language.
It's a really common
desire, right?
And so if you have
language, namely English,
and you're willing
to travel,
you've probably got a job
and you can probably
be making a competitive
wage someplace overseas
where maybe the cost
of living is lower.
So teaching English
is another way
and a really common thing
that people do
even after a bachelor's
in linguistics, right?
So this is a common path.
Speech pathology
and audiology
are another great place
that linguists end up.
Helping children
and adults with speech
and hearing disorders
is a common way
that people do this
because phonetics
is often studying
how this works sort of,
I don't want to say
normally necessarily,
but without pathology.
When you get into pathology,
it's like, okay,
why is this person
struggling to make this sound?
And working through them,
coaching that.
And then audiology
and hearing science
are really interesting.
You work with all sorts
of questions about,
you know,
why is speech perception
hard for this person?
What can we do
to help repair the ears?
Or in other cases,
what can we do
to make people,
to allow people
to live the best life
that they can
with whatever hearing loss
that they have?
Whether that's
in counseling them
towards interventions
or in counseling them
towards sign languages.
So all of these things
are possible.
And so working with adults
with speech and hearing disorders
is really common.
As is working with children
with language delays.
This is another area
that linguists can go into
where it's not
maybe necessarily physical,
it's not necessarily
a hearing issue,
but they just,
they are delayed in language.
So working with these kids
is another common path.
Then there are
academic positions.
Postdocs are becoming
increasingly common.
They're almost becoming
increasingly necessary.
Fewer and fewer people
are getting
a tenure-track job
immediately out of academic,
out of their PhD, that is.
You also get things
like administrative positions
or lab management positions
or researcher positions,
although those are
relatively rare.
But the thing is,
most folks want to do
what I'm doing.
We want to be
a tenure-track professor.
And as a professor,
you live a very strange life,
but it's a good one.
You have job security
eventually,
if you don't screw up.
I don't quite yet.
Hopefully I'll get tenure.
Please, please,
student evaluations
help me a lot, right?
Teaching professor, help!
But you have
job security eventually.
Once you get tenure,
that's important.
You'll do some research.
You'll also teach.
And you'll do
administrative stuff as well.
And all three of those
are a major component
of my life,
because a week
is roughly spent
doing those three things.
And occasionally,
I have a life
outside of school.
It's weird, right?
You'll also have to do things
like fighting for grant money
or fighting for money
within the university.
But you do it all
in the pursuit
of a field you love.
Remember,
you're researching
things that you love.
If you love language,
you're researching language.
You're teaching Ling 101,
which is amazing.
You're doing
administrative stuff
that is maybe not
things you love,
but it's so that
you can do more things
that you do love up here,
and so on and so forth.
It's a joy.
And so it's a wonderful position.
But there is a big problem
with planning to be a professor,
and that is the linguistics
academic job market,
which is, I think,
one of the circles of hell.
Dante wasn't super clear about it,
but I'm pretty sure,
because it is very, very sparse.
The academic job market
is tough.
Last year,
there were seven...
I'm sorry,
this is a year prior.
There were seven jobs
in syntax
at well-known schools total
last year.
I don't mean at the same time,
because the job market
for academics
is usually year-based,
so you have one application cycle
every year.
And last year,
or the year before last,
that is,
there were seven jobs
in syntax total,
and that was
an exceptionally good year.
That was a crazy year
for syntax.
Everybody wanted
a syntax position,
and so you could probably
find more
if you were willing
to look at schools
that are lesser known,
or if you're willing
to look outside
of the English-speaking world,
you can find additional ones.
But that was a really good year,
and that's seven jobs.
Competition is very,
very fierce.
Jobs will have
100-plus applicants
for one single position.
Of those,
maybe 10 will get...
well, no,
I guess it would be
Zoom interviews, right?
And three to six of them
will visit campus,
will actually get
to give a job talk,
will get to basically
plead their case
to the faculty themselves.
And all of that
is usually for one job.
There are sometimes
things where it's like,
well, we have two jobs,
and that's like,
oh my God,
yes, amazing!
But it's really tough
The advice that I got
that is good and terrible
all at the same time
is wait your turn,
you only need one job.
And that got me there,
but I'm not going to say
it was easy.
It was emotionally
very draining,
and the year that I got
this position
was the last year
I was planning to apply.
And so it is
very, very difficult.
The job market is tough,
and so if you're looking
at this going,
oh, I'm going to declare
a linguistics major,
then I'm going to be
a linguistics professor
just like Will.
I mean, ideally better.
But nonetheless,
great, have fun,
but ooh, boy,
you need to know
that you want to teach.
You need to know
that you want to do research.
You need to know
that you want an academic job
in order to put up with this.
This is a very real problem.
So it's not an easy life.
The other thing to remember
is that you're going
where work is, right?
I ended up in San Diego.
I'm super happy about that, right?
But the other jobs
that I had applied for that year
and that I was a candidate for
were in Delaware and Vancouver.
And so you're not really able
to say, well,
I want to live in,
you know, Duluth.
And be a linguistics professor.
I mean, you could get very lucky,
but chances are, no.
You're just going to go
wherever hires you.
And so definitely make sure
that your partner is mobile.
You also need to be able
to tread water financially
for a while.
Because grad school,
you're not making great money.
And you're taking a vow
of fiscal renunciation.
As an academic,
you make some money,
but you're not going to do
anywhere near as well
as some of your friends
and family and industry, right?
But still,
after four long years
in the job market,
here I am.
I'm actually getting to teach.
And that's an amazing thing.
I love it.
The thing is,
your life might not be like mine.
In many ways,
I really hope it isn't.
But this part of my life,
linguistics, language,
and teaching languages,
is an absolute joy for me.
I have found
a great deal of pleasure
in looking at these questions
that so many people
leave behind.
These things that
so many people ignore.
You might end up
going a different route.
You might choose
industry over academia.
And that's, in many ways,
a great choice, right?
You might choose
to pursue linguistics
as a component
of a different career elsewhere.
The fact is,
there are many people out there
who are linguists,
but who've decided,
you know what?
I'm a linguist,
but I really like computer science,
so I'm going to really be
the most linguistic-y
computer scientist in the room,
rather than vice versa.
And that's completely reasonable.
That's a good approach.
And you might combine
your love of language
with your love of something else.
All of these things
are possibilities.
And who knows?
You might even be able
to convince yourself
after this class
that you're a linguist somehow.
Go figure, right?
But your life
could be like mine.
And maybe you'll go down
the rabbit hole.
Maybe this class
will do for you
what 101 did for me
and leave you feeling like,
oh my God,
I can't not do this.
So remember back
when we started,
the very first video
for this course
about linguistics.
I mentioned to you
something that I really hope.
My secret goal
for this course
is that someday
you'll sit down
someplace or another
and you'll hear
two people talking.
And you will listen to them.
And now,
think about the complexity
that you can see
in that conversation.
You'll see them talking
and you'll look at
their mouths moving
and you'll be like,
oh my God,
their tongues are moving.
They're doing alveolar,
velar sounds.
They're jumping back and forth.
The movements,
the voicing is turning
on and off,
on and off,
on and off constantly.
And then that's turning
into little sound waves
and going into their ear,
which they're able
to reconstruct
even though it's bouncing
off of the bus
and everything like that
Then they're turning that
into chunks of sound
which they're combining
and they're understanding
that this chunk of sound
is different
because it's next to this one,
because of phonological rules.
And then those two things
combined make a morpheme
and those morphemes
stick together with these guys.
And then suddenly
that creates a brand new word
in that sentence alone
or maybe just generally speaking.
Maybe it's a brand new
derivational thing
they've just done.
And then those things
get stuck together
into bigger and bigger sentences.
And those sentences
are interpretable
either,
or maybe they're ambiguous.
But still,
we're able to interpret
the meaning of those
sentences
in a certain way.
Or maybe they're
talking about
being on the bus
or having a specific force
in the conversation.
And then those two people
are sitting there
in a discourse context
because they've been talking.
They already know
that they're talking about
being on the bus
or maybe they're talking about
that cat they saw last weekend.
There are so many parts
of this conversation
that you're not even aware of
that they're able to understand
but you are not
because of discourse context,
because of pragmatics.
And through that process,
through that process
of flapping bits of meat
around in their head
and hearing those things
and processing them
they are able
to share thoughts.
And that is
the coolest
damn
thing
ever.
And now you understand
just a little bit more
of how that works.
So,
you may live a life
doing something else.
But I hope
no matter what
you end up doing
with your life
that at some level
you understand
that language
is the most amazing thing
we ever will do
as a species
and that a life in language
is a life worth living.
So,
thank you all
so very, very much
for joining me
in this class.
I hope that it's been
interesting and entertaining
for you
and I very, very much
hope that
at some little level
at some point
in your lifetimes
you choose
and you are able
to see language
with the same sense
of joy and wonder
that I am
and that so many of us are
on a regular basis.
So,
thank you all
and have an absolutely
wonderful rest of your day.
May your lives
and language
have already begun.
Have a good one.
